            Hi, Iâ€™m Jaber. Nice to meet you.
          </h2>

            I got interested in programming a couple of years ago and I&#39;m
            enjoying coding ever since. For the last two years, reading
            documentation and articles, doing projects, and asking around about
            how to get my code to work have been highlights of my days. Now that
            I&#39;ve decided to pursue it as a career, I&#39;m excited to work
            as part of a team. So, if there is an opening for a passionate
            junior Front-end web developer, I believe I would be a perfect match
            for your team.
